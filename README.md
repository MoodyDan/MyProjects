Decided to learn Unity by making a very small project. Graphics is very basic because I wanted to draw it myself in vector style, and I do not know how to draw at all. The level was supposed to be bigger and more varied, but it turned out to be a challenge for a beginner. 

Eventually there was so much code and it was so unstructured that it became difficult to add new features, and there were constant conflicts with old features. That's why I decided to start a new project and prevent newcomer's mistakes in it. 

Still it was fun to work with character movement, object interaction, animation, AI, UI, as well as adding touch control and gamepad input (originally there was keyboard control), main menu and settings, pause and automatic screen adaptation for mobile devices.

All in all, the development took about a month at a few hours of work a day. I have not worked with any game engines or developed complex programs before.
