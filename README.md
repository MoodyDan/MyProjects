Ivan lives on the border of the Northern People's Republic, a communist state in 1991. The government of the republic opened the borders for trade. Ivan is in charge of controlling incoming goods for the country's citizens.

This game will also end its life at the demo level and will never be released. The game was very interesting and fun to make, but I want to focus on learning game design. For this game, I hand-drew most of the textures and also developed all game code, which made me a bit tired. Now I want to switch to Unreal Engine, to do projects in 3D. For the next projects, I will be focusing on engaging and unique gameplay. I also plan to use mostlty ready assets so I don't get distracted from working out the mechanics.

Decided to learn Unity by making a very small project. Graphics is very basic because I wanted to draw it myself in vector style, and I do not know how to draw at all. The level was supposed to be bigger and more varied, but it turned out to be a challenge for a beginner. 

Eventually there was so much code and it was so unstructured that it became difficult to add new features, and there were constant conflicts with old features. That's why I decided to start a new project and prevent newcomer's mistakes in it. 

Still it was fun to work with character movement, object interaction, animation, AI, UI, as well as adding touch control and gamepad input (originally there was keyboard control), main menu and settings, pause and automatic screen adaptation for mobile devices.

All in all, the development took about a month at a few hours of work a day. I have not worked with any game engines or developed complex programs before.
